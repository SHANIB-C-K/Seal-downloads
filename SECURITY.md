- [ ] Implement data migration for upgrades

### When Logging
- [ ] Always use `SecureLogger` instead of `android.util.Log`
- [ ] Never log sensitive information
- [ ] Use appropriate log levels
- [ ] Remember logs are stripped in release

## Certificate Pinning Maintenance

### Updating Certificate Pins

To update certificate pins when they expire:

```bash
# Get certificate from server
echo | openssl s_client -servername api.github.com -connect api.github.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64
```

Update the pins in `network_security_config.xml` before expiration date.

**⚠️ WARNING**: Always maintain at least 2 backup pins to prevent app lockout if primary certificate changes.

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review code for new vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated to latest secure versions
3. **Penetration Testing**: Consider professional security testing
4. **Code Reviews**: Implement security-focused code review processes

7. **Test Security Features**: Run security tests before each release
8. **Update Security Documentation**: Keep this document current

## Testing Security Fixes

To verify the security improvements:

1. **Build and Test**: Create release builds and verify obfuscation is working
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   # Check APK with jadx or similar tool to verify obfuscation
   ```

2. **Network Testing**: Verify HTTPS enforcement using network monitoring tools
   ```bash
   # Use Charles Proxy or mitmproxy to test certificate pinning
   # App should reject connections with invalid certificates
   ```

3. **File Access Testing**: Test file provider restrictions
   - Attempt to access files outside allowed directories
   - Verify file:// URIs are blocked

4. **Input Validation Testing**: Test with malicious inputs to verify sanitization
   - Directory traversal attempts (../, ~/, etc.)
   - Special characters in filenames
   - Malformed URLs and intents

5. **WebView Security Testing**:
   - Test XSS payload injection
   - Verify JavaScript interface removal
   - Check CSP enforcement

6. **Log Testing**: Verify no sensitive data in release logs
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -i "seal\|password\|token\|cookie"
   # Should show redacted or no output in release builds
   ```
